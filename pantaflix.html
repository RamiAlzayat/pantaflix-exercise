				<p>Welcome to the very first Pantaflix newsletter. We're here to make the future of film better and we're proud to have you supporting us. Start exploring <a class="a-color" href="#">our catalogue</a>, read more <a href="#" class="a-color">about us</a>, or <a href="#" class="a-color">get in touch</a> with thoughts and suggestions anytime.</p>
				<p>We're still new and are adding new films all time. Just recently we launched our wishlist feature which lets you keep track of anything you want to watch later (you'll need to register for a free account to save things). As our global HQ is in Berlin, how about putting the wonderfully titled 'Fucking Berlin' into your very own wishlist.</p>
				<p>Read more about what we're all about below, but don't forget that if you live abroad Pantaflix is where you can find films from back home that are otherwise impossible to watch.</p>
				<p>Need some help finding something great to watch? We think everyone should discover these four films:</p>
